# CardinalityEstimation

This project focus on compression of HyperLogLog sketch in cardinality estimation.
We aim to find some compression that does not introduce to large variance, easy to update,
and hopefully costs space about its information theoretical limit.

The python scripts runs simulations to compare the performance of our sketches.
By performance, we mean given the same space, how large is the estimation given by those
sketches.

totalling running history and figure files are too large to be uploaded.
